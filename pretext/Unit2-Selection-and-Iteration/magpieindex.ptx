  <title>Magpie Chatbot Lab</title>

  <introduction>
 
    <p>
      This is the original College Board Magpie lab from 2014. There is a new Magpie 2.0 lab as of 2025 
      which is available in the AP Classroom. It is very similar to the following lab, but must be done within AP 
      Classroom. You can use Runestone active codes below or in a Runestone assignment as your IDE to do 
      Magpie 2.0 coding activities as described in the AP Classroom.
